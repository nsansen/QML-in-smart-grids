# QML-in-smart-grids
Power Theft Detection in Smart Grids using Quantum Machine Learning


H1 = Hybrid number 1 
Q10 = 10 qubits
B1 = 1 Block
L1 = 1 LAyer

Noise = The model simulates a noisy quantum circuit
timestamp = Time variable is included in the dataset.

All codes use the same architecture which is a keras sequential LSTM network.
